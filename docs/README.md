## Key Components Summary

### Core Services
- **PR Analysis Service**: Extracts and processes pull request data
- **Groq AI Service**: Interfaces with AI models for code analysis
- **RAG Context Service**: Manages retrieval-augmented generation context
- **Rule Engine Service**: Evaluates code against rules and standards

### API Endpoints
- **Custom Rules Management**: CRUD operations for organization-specific rules
- **Manual PR Analysis**: Trigger analysis on-demand
- **Health Monitoring**: System status and diagnostics
- **Webhook Processing**: GitHub integration endpoints

### Error Handling
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services fail
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic recovery with exponential backoff
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health assessment

## System Capabilities

### Automated Analysis
- **Merge Score**: 0-100 score based on code quality, security, and compliance
- **Rule Evaluation**: Both default and custom rules with pattern matching
- **AI Suggestions**: Context-aware code improvement recommendations
- **Security Scanning**: Detection of potential vulnerabilities

### Intelligent Context
- **RAG Integration**: Uses historical PR data for context-aware analysis
- **Project Standards**: Learns from existing codebase patterns
- **Similar PR Detection**: Finds relevant historical examples
- **Code Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common patterns and anti-patterns

### Robust Operations
- **High Availability**: Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operating with reduced functionality
- **Error Recovery**: Automated recovery from service failures

## Configuration Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
GITHUB_APP_ID=your_github_app_id
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=your_github_private_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
MONITORING_WEBHOOK_URL=your_monitoring_webhook
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=your_alert_webhook
NODE_ENV=production
```

## API Quick Reference

### Custom Rules
```bash
# Get all rules
GET /ai-rules/:installationId

# Create rule
POST /ai-rules/:installationId

# Update rule
PUT /ai-rules/:installationId/:ruleId

# Delete rule
DELETE /ai-rules/:installationId/:ruleId
```

### Manual Analysis
```bash
# Trigger PR analysis
POST /github/installations/:installationId/analyze-pr
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Basic health
GET /health

# Detailed health
GET /health/detailed

# Error handling status
GET /health/error-handling
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Service Failures
- **AI Service Down**: Falls back to rule-based analysis
- **Vector DB Down**: Uses basic context without RAG
- **GitHub API Issues**: Stores results for later posting
- **Database Issues**: Temporary in-memory storage

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring with automated alerts
- **Manual Recovery**: Admin endpoints for forced system recovery
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on system termination

## Performance Characteristics

### Processing Times
- **Simple PRs**: 15-30 seconds
- **Medium PRs**: 30-60 seconds  
- **Complex PRs**: 60-120 seconds

### Scalability
- **Async Processing**: Background job queues
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections
- **Caching**: Health status and context caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects external service limits

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- GitHub App authentication for secure API access
- User permission validation for installations
- Webhook signature verification
- Secure environment variable handling

### Data Protection
- No permanent storage of sensitive code
- Anonymized embeddings for RAG
- Audit logging for access tracking
- Secure communication with external services

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collected
- AI review success/failure rates
- Service response times and error rates
- Circuit breaker status and recovery
- System resource usage and health

### Alerting Capabilities
- Critical system failures
- High error rates and performance issues
- Service unavailability notifications
- Resource exhaustion warnings

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **AI Analysis Failures**: Check Groq API key and rate limits
2. **Context Retrieval Issues**: Verify Pinecone configuration
3. **GitHub Integration Problems**: Validate app credentials and permissions
4. **Database Connection Issues**: Check connection string and network access

### Diagnostic Endpoints
- `/health/detailed`: Comprehensive system status
- `/health/error-handling`: Error handling system status
- Circuit breaker status in health responses
- Structured logging for issue investigation

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Service Recovery**: Use `/health/recover` endpoint (admin only)
2. **Circuit Breaker Reset**: Automatic after timeout or manual reset
3. **System Restart**: Graceful shutdown and restart procedures
4. **Configuration Reload**: Environment variable updates
