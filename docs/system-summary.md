- **Enhanced Context Building**: Combines multiple context sources for superior review quality
- **Context Quality Scoring**: Calculates context quality scores based on multiple factors
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces API calls and processing time through intelligent selection

### Traditional Analysis Integration
The intelligent context system seamlessly integrates with existing analysis methods:

- **RAG Context Retrieval**: Vector-based context from similar PRs and project patterns
- **Rule Engine**: Both default and custom rules evaluation
- **AI Analysis**: Groq AI-powered code analysis with enhanced context
- **Merge Score Calculation**: Comprehensive scoring based on multiple quality factors

### Robust Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling ensures system reliability:

- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures across services
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple fallback strategies for different failure scenarios
- **Automated Recovery**: Automated system recovery mechanisms

### Performance and Monitoring
Advanced monitoring and performance optimization:

- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive structured logging across all services
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed performance tracking and optimization

## Error Recovery Scenarios

### Service Failure Recovery
1. **Intelligent Context Failure** → Falls back to standard analysis
2. **Groq AI Failure** → Falls back to rule-based analysis
3. **Pinecone Failure** → Uses basic context without RAG
4. **GitHub API Failure** → Stores results for later posting
5. **Database Failure** → Uses in-memory storage temporarily

### System Recovery
1. **Circuit Breaker Recovery** → Automatic retry after timeout
2. **Health Check Recovery** → Periodic service validation
3. **Manual Recovery** → Admin endpoints for forced recovery

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Processing time (end-to-end and per-service)
- Success rate (percentage of successful reviews)
- Error rate (categorized by error type and service)
- Service health (real-time status of all dependencies)
- Intelligent context metrics (AI recommendation accuracy, quality scores)
- Context analysis performance (processing times, success rates, fallback usage)

### Alerting Triggers
- High error rate (>10% failures in 5-minute window)
- Service unavailability (any service down for >2 minutes)
- Processing delays (reviews taking >5 minutes)
- Resource exhaustion (memory/CPU usage >85%)
- Intelligent context degradation (high fallback rates or low quality scores)
